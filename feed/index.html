<p>Today, November 25, 2024, marks the 1-year anniversary of #EnuguWaterDay, a milestone that was supposed to herald a new era of access to clean and potable water for residents of Enugu Metropolis. While the Enugu State Government has made significant strides in rehabilitating the 9th mile scheme to boost water production, the reality on the ground tells a different story. Despite the progress, many homes across Enugu Metropolis still lack access to running water, leaving residents to rely on alternative and often expensive sources.</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><strong>Progress Made:</strong></div>
<p>The rehabilitation of the 9th mile scheme is a notable achievement that deserves commendation. This effort has the potential to increase water production and supply to homes across the metropolis. In addition, the government made water supply, a priority in its 2024 budgetary allocations. However, the impact of this progress is yet to be felt by many residents.</p>
<div dir="auto"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1253" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000-768x768.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20231206_104940_0000.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><strong>Challenges Persist:</strong></div>
<p>Despite the progress made, the taps in most homes across Enugu Metropolis remain dry. This is a stark reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that residents have access to clean and potable water. The lack of access to running water has significant implications for public health, economic productivity, and overall quality of life.</p>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><strong>Call to Action:</strong></div>
<p>As we mark the 1-year anniversary of #EnuguWaterDay, we urge the Enugu State Government to:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">1. Increase transparency and accountability in the water sector by assessing and making public, the performance of the state&#8217;s 2024 budget, as it relates to the water, sanitation and hygiene sector.</li>
<li dir="auto">2. Provide regular updates on the progress made and challenges in rehabilitating the water infrastructures. This includes updates on replacement and laying of new pipes for potable water reticulation to homes of Enugu residents.</li>
<li dir="auto">3. Engage with residents and stakeholders to understand their needs and concerns through Town Hall Meetings.</li>
</ol>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>The 1-year anniversary of #EnuguWaterDay is a mixed bag of progress and challenges. We hope that the Enugu State Government will take concrete steps to sustain the gains made and address the challenges, while ensuring that residents have access to clean and potable water.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria&#8217;s quest for a nationwide Open Defecation-Free (ODF) status has just received a significant boost. With only 17 percent of local governments certified as ODF since the launch of the Clean Nigeria Campaign five years ago, there is no gainsaying that the initial 2025 target is no longer feasible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5191" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ODF-2-300x245-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ODF-2-300x245-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ODF-2-1024x838-1.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ODF-2-768x628-1.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ODF-2.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>In response, the Nigerian Government has launched a revised strategic plan, setting a new target of 2030 for all 774 local governments to achieve ODF status. The launch took place at the event to mark 2024 World Toilet Day as well as the 5th Year anniversary of the Clean Nigeria Campaign. This move marks a pivotal step forward in addressing Nigeria&#8217;s sanitation challenges, particularly given that nearly 48 million people still practice open defecation, and even more lack access to safely managed sanitation services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5211" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1-300x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1-300x300-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1-1024x1024-1.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1-150x150-1.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1-768x768-1.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clean-energy-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The success of this revised plan relies heavily on collective efforts and commitments from stakeholders, especially at state and local government levels. Lessons learned from the past five years will be crucial in making this vision a reality.</p>
<p>This revised plan demonstrates the federal government&#8217;s commitment to achieving a cleaner, healthier Nigeria. In meeting this new target, a pragmatic shift from business-as-usual is now inevitable and state governments must be made accountable for the progress in their respective states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 19th marks World Toilet Day, a day to raise awareness about the importance of sanitation and hygiene. This year&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Toilet &#8211; A place for Peace,&#8221; may seem unusual, but it highlights the often-overlooked role that toilets play in our lives. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the significance of toilets as a place for peace and how this concept can inspire us to work towards a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
<p><strong>The Toilet as a Sanctuary</strong></p>
<p>For many of us, the toilet is an ordinary, everyday space that we often take for granted. However, for others, the toilet is a rare sanctuary, a place to escape the stresses of daily life. In refugee camps, toilets are often the only private space available, providing a brief respite from the chaos and uncertainty of displacement.</p>
<p>In our own lives, the toilet can be a place for solitude, where we can collect our thoughts, and recharge. It&#8217;s a space where we can be alone, without the distractions of the outside world. In an increasingly fast-paced and interconnected world, the toilet can be a rare oasis of peace.</p>
<p><strong>The Intersection of Sanitation and Peace</strong></p>
<p>The connection between sanitation and peace may seem tenuous at first, but it&#8217;s actually quite profound. When we think of peace, we often think of grand, abstract concepts like conflict resolution and international diplomacy. However, peace is also about the small, everyday moments of dignity and comfort that we often take for granted.</p>
<p>Sanitation is a fundamental human right, and access to safe, clean toilets is essential for maintaining dignity and promoting peace. When people have access to sanitation, they are more likely to feel safe, secure, and at peace.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking the Silence</strong></p>
<p>Despite its importance, sanitation remains a taboo topic in many cultures. We rarely talk about toilets or sanitation in polite conversation, and when we do, it&#8217;s often with a sense of embarrassment or shame.</p>
<p>However, breaking the silence around sanitation is essential for promoting peace and dignity. By talking openly and honestly about sanitation, we can raise awareness about the importance of access to safe, clean toilets, and work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
<p>Finally, as we mark World Toilet Day, let&#8217;s take a moment to appreciate the humble toilet, and the important role it plays in our lives. The toilet may seem like an unlikely place for peace, but it&#8217;s actually a sanctuary, a space where we can find solitude, dignity, and comfort.</p>
<p>By recognizing the intersection of sanitation and peace, we can work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world, where everyone has access to safe, clean toilets, and the dignity and peace that comes with it.</p>
<p>This World Toilet Day, let&#8217;s break the silence around sanitation, and work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world!</p>
<p>Together, we can create a world where everyone has access to safe, clean toilets, and the dignity and peace that comes with it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enugu State has reached another milestone in its quest to revamp and restructure the state&#8217;s WASH sector for optimal WASH services delivery by successfully transitioning the WASH Units across all the seventeen (17) Local Government Councils in the state to WASH Department</p>
<p>In a letter dated, 23rd October 2024, and addressed to all the newly elected 17 Local government Chair, the State Governor, Dr. Peter Ndubuisi Mbah approved the upgrade of the WASH Units to full fledged Departments that will have the same status as the other seven (7) departments in the Local Government Councils.</p>
<p>Prior to this approval, some of the WASH interventions at the Local Government level were carried out by WASH Units, which were under the Department of Health. However, with this new status, all rural water,  sanitation and hygiene projects will be domiciled in the department.</p>
<p>The newly established WASH Department is saddled with the following responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the delivery of  appropriate interventions by both direct provision of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) promotion in liaison with local and international partners.</li>
<li>Locate, document, monitor and supervise all the state WASH assets in the respective LGAs. The WASH Department is to interface with all partners with the oversight of Enugu State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (ENRUWASSA).</li>
</ol>
<p>This development is another step taken by the state government towards strengthening the WASH systems at the local government level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A staggering disparity exists in Open Defecation-Free (ODF) status across regions of Nigeria. While 50% of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the North West have achieved ODF status, a mere 1% in the South West have reached this milestone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Alarming Gap</strong></p>
<p>This striking contrast is a pointer that suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unequal access to safe sanitation.</li>
<li>Regional disparities in sanitation infrastructure.</li>
<li>Varying levels of community engagement and awareness.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consequences of the Divide</strong></p>
<p>The sanitation divide perpetuates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human Rights violations: Access to sanitation is a human right. The rights of people in regions without access to safe sanitation services and facilities, are grossly abused.</li>
<li>Health risks: Open defecation spreads diseases, which can lead to loss of lives and livelihoods.</li>
<li>Environmental degradation and abuse of environmental rights: Open defecation leads to environmemtal pollution and contamination, which ultimately violates people&#8217;s environmental rights.</li>
<li>Economic disparities: Sanitation affects productivity and economic growth. Therefore, the sanitation divide across Nigeria will further deepen economic disparities across states and regions of Nigeria.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Closing the Gap</strong></p>
<p>To bridge this divide, we must beam the searchlight on those regions that lag behind, intensifying sanitation initiatives and increasing sanitation investments in those regions. There is a cogent need to also promote inter-regional collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Bridging Nigeria&#8217;s sanitation divide requires collective action. By addressing regional disparities, we can ensure equal access to safe sanitation, promoting health, dignity, and economic growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria&#8217;s sanitation landscape presents a stark reality. As of September 2024, only 134 Local Government Areas (LGAs) out of 774 have achieved Open Defecation-Free (ODF) status. More alarming is that 17 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, still have zero ODF LGAs, a year before the target year &#8211; 2025 &#8211; by which time all 774 LGAs across the country is expected to be open-defecation-free.</p>
<p><strong>The Math Behind the Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Using Temple Chukwuemeka Oraeki&#8217;s ODF Math:</p>
<p>x &#8211; y = z</p>
<p>x = 774 (Total LGAs in Nigeria)</p>
<p>y = 134 (Current ODF LGAs)</p>
<p>z = Number of LGAs yet to be ODF (640)</p>
<p>The Target: z = 0 by 2025</p>
<p>With barely a year left to achieve this target, critical questions arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>At what rate must progress be made to reach z = 0 by 2025?</li>
<li>What strategies can be employed to accelerate sanitation efforts?</li>
<li>Will combining past efforts suffice to achieve the target, or is a radical shift necessary?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Imperative for Accelerated Progress</strong></p>
<p>The numbers underscore the urgency for Nigeria to exponentially scale up its sanitation initiatives. The country must at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intensify community-led total sanitation (CLTS) and sustainable total sanitation approach, which incorporates sanitation marketing to improve toilet uptakes.</li>
<li>Enhance policy implementation and access to sustainable sanitation financing models across states.</li>
<li>Deepen inter-sectoral collaborations, especially with the private sector.</li>
<li>Leverage technology to enhance accountability within the sector.</li>
<li>Adopt citizen-science approach to generate evidence-based data to improve demand and supply of improved sanitation services across states in Nigeria.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s sanitation revolution requires collective action. We must confront the stark reality, acknowledge progress made, and strive for exponential growth. Achieving &#8216;z&#8217; close to zero by 2025 demands unwavering commitment, innovative strategies, and sustained efforts.</p>

<p>The private sector plays a critical role in developing and implementing effective sanitation and hygiene infrastructures. With the increasing demand for improved sanitation services, innovative solutions and sustainable investments from private entities are essential. According to the World Bank, achieving universal access to basic sanitation by 2030 will require an estimated $114 billion per year in capital investment. This figure highlights the significant role that private investments can play in bridging the financing gap.</p>
<p>Private companies and organizations bring not only financial resources but also technical expertise, innovation, and efficiency in project implementation. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have proven to be effective in many states and regions, providing sustainable sanitation solutions that are scalable and replicable. These partnerships leverage the strengths of both sectors to improve infrastructure, service delivery, and community engagement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week on #EnuguWASHRadioSeries, the discourse focused how private sector involvement can be optimized to support sanitation and hygiene service delivery and outcomes.</p>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>The Resource Persons on this episode include; Henrietta Nzekwe, the Principal Planning Officer, Enugu State Economic Planning Commission, Barr. Crownwell Chibuzor, Human Rights and Civil Responsibilities Advocate, and Mr. Emeka Fabian Odugu, a Toilet Business Owner.</p>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">The Resource persons shared insights on:</div>
<div dir="auto">■ Successful PPP models</div>
<div dir="auto">■ Challenges and opportunities for collaboration</div>
<div dir="auto">■ Effective partnership strategies</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2358" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240927-WA0006-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240927-WA0006-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240927-WA0006-1024x767.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240927-WA0006-768x575.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240927-WA0006.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fabian, who is a toilet business owner (TBO) that has successfully worked in partnership with both Enugu State Government and WaterAid Nigeria in installing toilets in houses across Enugu, stated that he was just a plumber until he was trained by WaterAid on Water Easy Toilet (WET) installation, which opened his eyes to the vast opportunity in the sector. He urged the state government to create a platform or scheme in partnership with development partners (such as WaterAid) where more youth can be mobilized and trained on sanitation business across various communities and local government areas in Enugu.</p>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>Barr. Crownwell, on the other hand, encouraged the private sector players to invest in the sanitation value chain in Enugu State but stressed that Government has to take the lead by creating enabling environment, incentives, and legal framework that supports ease-of-doing-business. According to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="auto">Sanitation is a money spinner but private sector players have not thought of it innovatively beyond croporate social responsibility.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Henrietta, who was the Government Representative on the episode stressed that the state government has created the enabling environment. In her words,</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="auto">The legal and regulatory frameworks are already in place in Enugu State. Private investors should be confident to invest and be reassured that their investment is safe.</div>
</blockquote>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>In concluding the episode, the Resource Persons cited case studies of cost-effective SATO Toilets installed in some rural communities across Enugu State. They further emphasized the need for more private sector players to key into the lucrative sanitation business in Enugu State, which has been made more viable through the enabling environment created by the Dr. Peter Mbah-led government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>NEWARI &#8211; Charges Newly Elected Local Government Chairs to Prioritize Access to Clean Water and Sanitation</strong></h2>
<p>Enugu, Nigeria &#8211; The Network of Water Rights Initiative (NEWARI) congratulates the newly elected Local Government Chairmen in Enugu State on their recent election victories. As they begin their tenures.  NEWARI urges them to key into the disruptive developmental agenda of the State Governor by making access to clean water and sanitation a top priority in their respective Local Government Areas (LGAs).</p>
<p>The Enugu State Governor, Dr. Peter N. Mbah on December 22, 2023, signed Executive Order 006 &#8211; Order for Open Defecation Free Enugu and Other Related Matters in Enugu Metropolis and the State. This Executive Order demonstrates a clear vision, interest and political will of the state government to achieving sustainable open defecation-free status across Enugu State. The Order mandates the provision of accessible toilets and handwashing facilities in all households and public places, including schools, hospitals, and market places.</p>
<p>In addition to the Executive Order 006, the state government has successfully mobilized the previous Local Government Administrators to pass ODF bye-laws whilst also launching the Enugu State Water Sector Law, 2021 that recognizes access to water and sanitation as human right.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1956 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Toilet-facility-300x300.jpeg" alt="Toilet Facility" width="318" height="318" /></p>
<p>To sustain these gains and facilitate more sustainable development in Enugu State water and sanitation sector, NEWARI calls on the newly elected Chairmen to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforce LGA ODF Bye-Laws: Ensure effective implementation of the Bye-Law Against Open Defecation in each LGA, with appropriate sanctions and penalties.</li>
<li>Standard Inclusive Sanitation Facilities: Incorporate construction of standard inclusive sanitation facilities into development projects.</li>
<li>Collaboration with WASH Office: Work closely with the WASH Office of the Ministry of Water Resources to implement Executive Order 006.</li>
<li>Adequate budgetary allocation: Allocate sufficient budgets for WASH initiatives.</li>
<li>Community Engagement and Ownership: Engage with communities, grassroots organizations and development partners to promote behavioral change within communities and facilitate ownership of WASH projects in their respective communities.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1968 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Swearing-in-ceremony-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Swearing-in-ceremony-300x200.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Swearing-in-ceremony-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Swearing-in-ceremony.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>By prioritizing access to clean water and sanitation, the newly elected Chairmen can significantly improve the health, well-being, and economic productivity of their constituents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is drastically altering the world we live in. Climate change poses significant risks to sanitation infrastructure and services, particularly in vulnerable communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 confirms that global warming is projected to intensify the global water cycle and, in doing so, directly impact sanitation systems. This will further hamper progress on SDG6 and undermine the health and well-being of billions of people. Today, an estimated 113 million Nigerians lack access to basic sanitation services and most of these people live in water-stressed or flood-prone areas, a problem that is increasing due to climate change.</p>
<p>Households that have gained access to basic sanitation services risk losing them during climate-related disasters, changes in climate patterns and sea level rise, unless due consideration and diligence are undertaken to inform design and development of such systems, taking into account mitigation of potential risks and shocks.</p>
<p>The Intersection of Climate Change and Sanitation:</p>
<p>Climate change affects sanitation in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased flooding: Floods could damage sanitation infrastructures, contaminating water sources and escalating the risk of disease spread.</li>
<li>Drought and water scarcity: Changes in precipitation patterns impact sanitation services. Water is key to realizing a decent toilet. With droughts and water scarcity, it is increasingly difficult to get access to a clean and decent toilet.<br />
3. Displacement and migration: Climate-related displacement strains sanitation infrastructure and services. This is evident in most displaced camps where hundreds or thousands of people displaced from their homes struggle to access limited toilet facilities, where it exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>The 5th episode of the #EnuguWASHRadioSeries focused on Climate-resilient WASH services and facilities. To deepen the discourse around this topical issue, our guests shared insights on integrating climate-resilient considerations into the state sanitation policies. This came at a crucial time when Enugu State is in the process of developing its policies.</p>
<p>The Resource Persons on the programme included Hon. Princess Eneh, Member representing Enugu South Rural Constituency in the Enugu State House of Assembly &#038; House Committee Chair on Water Resources, as well as Dr. Ebere Udeh, an Environmentalist and former National Secretary, Nigeria Environmental Society.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1929" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240920-WA0006-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240920-WA0006-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240920-WA0006-1024x767.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240920-WA0006-768x575.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240920-WA0006.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Both Resource Persons provided insights on how the Enugu State government can sustainably integrate climate-resilient technologies and standards into Water, Sanitation &#038; Hygiene (WASH) facilities and services. Dr. Ebere emphasized the need for adequate regulation to ensure climate-resilient standards are set and met for WASH facilities in the state. She stressed that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Enugu Water Sector Law, 2021 has already made the provision for a WASH regulatory body to be established in the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>She urged the Governor to prioritize the implementation of this provision of the state water law, if the government is genuinely interested in leaving a legacy of sustainable and climate-resilient WASH systems in the state.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the State Legislator stated that her committee worked closely with the state ministry of water resources in planning and drafting the state WASH budget for 2024. She emphasized that as a Representative of Rural Constituency, she ensured the rural constituents were not left behind in the State&#8217;s 2024 WASH budget and committed to following up to ensure budgeted funds are released for rural WASH interventions in the state.</p>
<p>Tune in to join the discussion every Friday on Solid 100.9 FM, Enugu by 9AM (GMT+1).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 79th United Nations General Assembly marks a pivotal moment in the quest to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Summit of the Future highlights the urgent need for international cooperation to tackle pressing issues like climate change, poverty, inequality, conflicts, and global health crises. The summit aims to mobilize political leadership, foster multisectoral collaboration, and ensure accountability for a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Attaining the desired outcomes from two of the high-level meetings at the summit, bothers heavily on taking actionable commitments to ensure water security, globally.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sea Level Rise (September 25, 2024):</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At this high-level plenary meeting on sea level rise, global leaders will convene to address the escalating threat of rising sea levels, promoting collaboration and international cooperation for a resilient future.</p>
<p>This session buttresses the climate change &#8211; water nexus and offers a leapfrog opportunity to rightfully place &#8216;water&#8217; at the heart of climate actions, globally.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) (September 26, 2024)</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>At this high-level meeting on Antimicrobial resistance, countries and stakeholders will renew efforts to combat AMR, strengthening health systems, promoting responsible antimicrobial use, and advancing new treatments.</p>
<p>This session buttresses the water-health nexus. It offers a veritable platform to prioritize and highlight the critical role of water in combating antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>For more information on the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 79) and these critical meetings, see <a href="https://www.un.org/en/high-level-week-2024/#AMR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>.</p>
